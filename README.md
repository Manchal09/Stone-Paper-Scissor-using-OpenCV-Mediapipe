# Stone-Paper-Scissor-using-OpenCV-Mediapipe
This project is a real-time Rock–Paper–Scissors game using OpenCV and MediaPipe for hand-gesture detection. The system continuously tracks fingertip landmarks, recognizes gestures, and plays against the computer with score tracking and a cooldown between moves.
