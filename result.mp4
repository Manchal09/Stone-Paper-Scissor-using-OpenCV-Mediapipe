Once the application starts, the webcam feed is processed in real time using OpenCV. 
At the same time, MediaPipe Hands extracts 21 landmark coordinates from the user's hand, allowing the system to understand the relative position of each finger.
Based on these landmarks, the program applies simple geometric rules to classify the gesture into Rock (all fingers closed), Paper (all fingers open), or Scissors 
(only index and middle finger extended).
After the user’s gesture is detected, the computer randomly chooses its own move. 
The game logic then compares both moves and determines the winner according to classic Rock–Paper–Scissors rules.
The result, along with the running score, is displayed on the screen. 
To avoid accidental repeated detections, a 5-second cooldown timer is applied after each round, while hand tracking continues smoothly in the background.
